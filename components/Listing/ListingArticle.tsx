                    Centrally positioned within the fantastic community of
                    Carrington, the harbour and city on your doorstep, this
                    character-rich weatherboard home showcases a winning
                    combination of timeless turn of the century style and a
                    contemporary renovation. Whilst retaining itâ€™s original
                    charm with high ceilings, arched hallway and ornate
                    fireplaces this home has also recently received updates with
                    a brand new gas equipped kitchen, two new bathrooms, new
                    plumbing and completely re-painted inside and out, just to
                    name a few. Flexible in configuration, the front room could
                    be used as an office, second living area or fourth bedroom.
                    The air-conditioned upstairs master bedroom is generous in
                    size and opens onto the front balcony. The rear of the home
                    has been completely renovated with new Jarrah flooring and
                    an open plan dining/kitchen area that flows freely to the
                    covered timber deck overlooking a fully fenced yard complete
                    with vegie gardens. Also providing prized off-street parking
                    this home is truly an exceptional property that is sure to
                    impress.
